## 🛠️ How It Works

- The extension watches the video frame every second.
- If it detects a **significant visual change**, it assumes the slide has changed.
- Then, it captures a screenshot and saves it to your default Downloads folder.

> ℹ️ The extension remains **OFF by default**. You can toggle it ON when needed.
